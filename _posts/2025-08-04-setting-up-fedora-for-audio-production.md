## Installing Bitwig

Bitwig is available for Linux in two flavours. There's a Flatpak version, and an official Ubuntu package. I'm staying away from the Flatpak version due to Flatpak's sandboxing, which prevents us from using [yabridge](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge) and [Jack](https://jackaudio.org/).

To install the Ubuntu version on Fedora we will need to convert the `.deb` package into `rpm` format. For this, I'm using [alien](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/alien/alien/#:~:text=Alien%20is%20a%20program%20that,package%20format%20and%20install%20it.), which is a Linux tool for converting between different package formats:

```bash
# Install alien
sudo dnf install alien
```
    
Next, [download Bitwig for Ubuntu](https://www.bitwig.com/download/) and convert the `.deb` package to `rpm`:

```bash
# Download Bitwig from https://www.bitwig.com/download/ then
cd ~/Downloads

# Create our Bitwig rpm
sudo alien -r bitwig-studio-5.3.12.deb
```

> Having created the `.rpm` package, I was still not able to `dnf install` it, so we'll manually install the binary and create a `.desktop` entry for KDE's launcher.
{: .prompt-info }

```bash
# Create a temporary directory
mkdir ~/bitwig-extract

cd ~/bitwig-extract

# Extract the Bitwig package
rpm2cpio ~/Downloads/bitwig-studio-5.3.12-2.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv

# Install the Bitwig binary manually
sudo mkdir -p /opt/bitwig-studio
sudo cp -r opt/bitwig-studio/* /opt/bitwig-studio/

# Create system-wide command
sudo ln -s /opt/bitwig-studio/bitwig-studio /usr/local/bin/bitwig
```

At this point you should be able to run Bitwig from the command line:

```bash
bitwig
```

Next, we will create a desktop entry for KDE's launcher:

```bash
# Copy desktop entry
cp usr/share/applications/bitwig.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/

# Copy icon to permanent location
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/

cp /home/aaron/bitwig-extract/usr/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/com.bitwig.BitwigStudio.png ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/bitwig.png
```

> Until Bitwig supports Wayland natively, you will still see the X11 icon in the panel when Bitwig is running. There may be a workaround for this, but I've not been able to find one at the time of writing.
{: .prompt-info }

Next we will create the `.desktop` file:

```bash
nano ~/.local/share/applications/bitwig.desktop
```

Paste in the following contents, which defines our desktop entry:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Categories=AudioVideo;Audio;Music;Midi;
Comment=
Exec=/opt/bitwig-studio/BitwigStudio
Icon=com.bitwig.BitwigStudio
Name=Bitwig Studio
NoDisplay=false
Path=
PrefersNonDefaultGPU=false
StartupNotify=true
Terminal=false
TerminalOptions=
Type=Application
X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false
X-KDE-Username=
StartupWMClass=com.bitwig.BitwigStudio
```

Save and exit from `nano` (`CTRL+O` then `CTRL+X`):

Next, update the system desktop entries and icons using: 

```
kbuildsycoca5
gtk-update-icon-cache ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/
```

Finally, clean up temporary files:

```bash
cd ~
rm -rf ~/bitwig-extract
```

At this point you can use Bitwig, and it should be available in the application launcher. If you would like to find out how to configure the system for performance, and set up `yabridge` for VST plugins, please read on!

## System Optimization

Now we'll optimise the system for audio. Firstly, we'll install `rtcqs` which is a utility diagnosing potetial issues relating to audio performace.

As a prerequisite, ensure that `python3-tkinter` is installed.


```bash
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```

```bash
mkdir -p ~/path/to/rtcqs
cd ~/path/to/rtcqs
python3 -m venv venv &&
. venv/bin/activate &&
pip install --upgrade rtcqs
```

then

```bash
rtcqs_gui
```

Later on, if you come back to `rtcqs` you will need to activate the virtual environment again.

```bash
cd ~/path/to/rtcqs
. venv/bin/activate
rtcqs_gui
```

`rtcqs` found a range of potential issues on my system. I've recorded here the issues it found, and the fixes which I've applied. YMMV. 

### Group limits

> User aaron is currently not member of a group that has sufficient rtprio (0) and memlock (8388608) set. Add yourself to a group with sufficent limits set, i.e. audio or realtime, with 'sudo usermod -a -G <group_name> aaron. See also https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#audio_group 
{: .prompt-warning 

My current user was not assigned to a group with sufficient rtprio and memlock set. Run the following command to list groups with rtprio and memlock limits:

```bash
$ grep -r 'rtprio\|memlock' /etc/security/limits.d/

/etc/security/limits.d/25-pw-rlimits.conf:@pipewire   - rtprio  70
/etc/security/limits.d/25-pw-rlimits.conf:@pipewire   - memlock 4194304
/etc/security/limits.d/95-jack.conf:@jackuser - rtprio 70
/etc/security/limits.d/95-jack.conf:@jackuser - memlock 4194304
/etc/security/limits.d/95-jack.conf:@pulse-rt - rtprio 20
/etc/security/limits.d/realtime.conf:@realtime       -       rtprio          99
/etc/security/limits.d/realtime.conf:@realtime       -       memlock         unlimited
```

I could see that the `@realtime` group has the appropriate `rtprio` and `memlock` limits. To fix this issue I had to assign myself to the `realtime` group: 

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G realtime aaron

# this will reboot the system (needed to apply changes)
sudo reboot
```

Once the system is rebooted, we can double check to see if the group change has been applied:

```bash
$ groups aaron

aaron : aaron wheel video docker realtime
```

### Simultaneous Multithreading

> Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT, also called hyper-threading) is enabled. This can cause spikes in DSP load at higher DSP loads. Consider disabling SMT when experiencing such spikes with 'echo off | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control'. See also https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#simultaneous_multithreading
{: .prompt-warning 

To check if smt is enabled, run the following command:

```bash
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control

# command output
on
```

We can see in the output that `smt` is set to `on`.

To disable temporariy `smt` run the following:

```bash
echo off | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control

# output
off
```

If you want to make this change persistent across reboots, we have to update `grub` config. 

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Find the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` line, and add `nosmt`


```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rhgb quiet nosmt"
```

Save and exit from `nano` (`CTRL+O` then `CTRL+X`).

Then update run the following command to update the `grub` configuration file:

```bash
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg

Generating grub configuration file ...
Adding boot menu entry for UEFI Firmware Settings ...
done
```

Then `sudo reboot` to reboot the system.

### CPU Scaling

> The scaling governor of one or more CPUs is not set to 'performance'. You can set the scaling governor to 'performance' with 'cpupower frequency-set -g performance' or 'cpufreq-set -r -g performance' (Debian/Ubuntu). See also https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#cpu_frequency_scaling

For this one I had to set the performance governour of my CPU to `performace`. 

Common governors include performance (highest frequency), powersave (lowest frequency), ondemand (dynamic based on load), conservative (similar to ondemand but with more gradual changes), and userspace (allows user-defined frequencies).

To set temporarily, use the following command:

```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

To persist this change, we will need to create a systemd service which runs on boot.

> I haven't set this up on my machine as I don't require `performance` mode to be activated all the time and doing so causes my machine to heat up a fair bit. I prefer to keep my machine running as cool as possible most of the time, so will manually set the governor as required. 
{: .prompt-info }

Since the command requires sudo and is related to system power management, itâ€™s best to create a systemd service to ensure it runs at boot.

First, you'll need to create a systemd service that runs this command when the system boots.

Open a terminal and create a new service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cpupower-performance.service
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Set CPU governor to performance

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cpupower frequency-set -g performance
User=root
Group=root
RemainAfterExit=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
This service will run the cpupower command to set the governor to performance during the boot sequence.


Reload systemd and enable the service:

After saving the service file, reload the systemd manager and enable the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cpupower-performance.service
```

Then start the service

```bash
sudo systemctl start cpupower-performance.service
```

Now, the CPU governor will automatically be set to performance on every boot.

### Preempt RT

> Kernel 6.15.8-200.fc42.x86_64 without 'threadirqs' parameter or real-time capabilities found. See also https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#do_i_really_need_a_real-time_kernel
{: .prompt-warning 

Threaded IRQs (Interrupt Requests) in the Linux kernel allow interrupt handling to be split into two parts: a "hard IRQ" handler that runs in interrupt context (with minimal work) and a "threaded IRQ" handler that runs in a kernel thread context, enabling more complex operations. This separation helps minimize the time interrupts are disabled, improving system responsiveness and simplifying interrupt handling, according to the Linux Device Drivers book.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Update `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` to include `threadirqs`

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rhgb quiet nosmt threadirqs"
```

Then make the `grub` configuration file and reboot:

```bash
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg
sudo reboot
```

### Spectre/Meltdown Mitigations

> Kernel with Spectre/Meltdown mitigations found. This could have a negative impact on the performance of your system. See also https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#disabling_spectre_and_meltdown_mitigations
{: .prompt-warning 

This one I am leaving as-is. I don't want to open up my system to potential cyber attacks. For systems which are completely offline, I might consider disabling mitigations, but for the relatively minor performance boost, and considering the amount of third-party code I run on my machine, I'm happy to leave the mitigations in place. 

### Swappiness

> The following mounts should be avoided for audio purposes: /boot. See also https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#filesystems
{: .prompt-warning 

The solution for this one is pretty straight-forward. We'll need to create a new system configuration file to override the swappiness with a lower value.

```
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-custom-sysctl.conf
```

Then add the following contents:

```
vm.swappiness=10
```

Then `sudo reboot` to apply the changes.

### Filesystem

> The following mounts should be avoided for audio purposes: /boot. See also https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#filesystems

Setting up a dedicated partition for audio on Fedora involves creating a separate partition on your disk, formatting it with an appropriate filesystem, and then configuring it for use. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to setting it up:

1. Identify the Disk and Create a Partition
Before you create a new partition, you'll need to identify the disk where you want to allocate space for audio.

Step 1: Identify the disk
Open a terminal and use lsblk to list the available block devices (disks):

bash
Copy
Edit
lsblk
This will list all the disks and partitions on your system, like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0  500G  0 disk
â”œâ”€sda1        8:1    0  500M  0 part /boot
â”œâ”€sda2        8:2    0  100G  0 part /
â””â”€sda3        8:3    0  400G  0 part
In this example, let's assume that /dev/sda3 is the free partition that we want to allocate for audio storage.

Step 2: Create a new partition (if necessary)
If you don't have an unused partition, you can use gdisk (for GPT partitioning) or fdisk (for MBR) to create one. Here's how to use gdisk to create a new partition:

Run gdisk on the target disk (in this case, /dev/sda):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo gdisk /dev/sda
Create a new partition:

Press n to create a new partition.

Choose a partition number (the default is fine).

Select the partition size (you can choose the full remaining space or a specific size).

Choose the default partition type (8300 for Linux filesystem).

Write the changes:

Press w to write the partition table and exit gdisk.

Now, you should have a new partition (e.g., /dev/sda3).

2. Format the New Partition
You need to format the new partition with a filesystem. We'll use ext4 because itâ€™s stable and works well for most Linux workloads, but you could also use XFS for better performance with large files.

To format the partition, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
This will format /dev/sda3 with the ext4 filesystem.

3. Create a Mount Point
Now you need to create a mount point where the new partition will be accessed. For example, you could mount it under /mnt/audio (you can choose any directory, but this is a common convention for mounting additional partitions).

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkdir /mnt/audio
4. Edit /etc/fstab to Mount the Partition on Boot
To ensure that the partition is mounted automatically every time the system boots, you'll need to add it to your /etc/fstab.

Get the UUID of the newly created partition:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo blkid /dev/sda3
The output will look something like this:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
/dev/sda3: UUID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" TYPE="ext4"
Copy the UUID (the long alphanumeric string).

Open /etc/fstab in a text editor:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add the following line at the end of the file:

ini
Copy
Edit
UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx /mnt/audio ext4 defaults,noatime 0 2
Replace xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx with the UUID of your partition.

defaults: Default mount options.

noatime: Avoid updating the last access time of files, which reduces disk I/O.

The 0 2 at the end of the line indicates that the partition should be checked after the root partition at boot (this is typical for non-boot partitions).

Save and exit the editor.

5. Mount the Partition
To mount the partition without rebooting, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mount -a
This command reads /etc/fstab and mounts any partitions listed there that are not already mounted.

6. Verify the Mount
Check that the partition is correctly mounted:

bash
Copy
Edit
lsblk
You should see your new partition listed with /mnt/audio as the mount point:

bash
Copy
Edit
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0  500G  0 disk
â”œâ”€sda1        8:1    0  500M  0 part /boot
â”œâ”€sda2        8:2    0  100G  0 part /
â””â”€sda3        8:3    0  400G  0 part /mnt/audio
7. Use the Audio Partition
Now that your partition is set up, you can start storing your audio data in /mnt/audio. You can create directories and store projects, audio files, buffers, or whatever data is needed for your audio production workflow.

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir /mnt/audio/projects
mkdir /mnt/audio/recordings
You can also change the ownership of this partition to your user, so you donâ€™t need to use sudo to write files:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /mnt/audio
8. Optional: Set Up Performance Optimizations
For audio workloads, itâ€™s important to optimize your disk for performance. Here are a few optional steps:

Disable access time updates: The noatime option (set in /etc/fstab) prevents the kernel from updating the access time of files when they are read, which can reduce unnecessary disk writes and improve performance.

Use SSD: If possible, consider using a Solid-State Drive (SSD) for your audio partition, as it will provide much faster read and write speeds compared to traditional hard drives.
